        Terms &amp; Conditions<br /><br />These terms and conditions applies to
        the permitfinder app (hereby referred to as &quot;Application&quot;) for
        mobile devices that was created by 9446184 Canada inc. (hereby referred
        to as &quot;Service Provider&quot;) as a Commercial service.<br /><br /><br /><br />Upon
        downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing
        to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read
        and understand these terms prior to using the Application. Unauthorized
        copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application,
        or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the
        source code of the Application, translate the Application into other
        languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All
        trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property
        rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service
        Provider.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Service Provider is dedicated to
        ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as
        possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or
        charge for their services at any time and for any reason. The Service
        Provider assures you that any charges for the Application or its
        services will be clearly communicated to you.<br /><br /><br /><br />The
        Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to
        the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your
        responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the
        Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking
        or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and
        limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
        Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious
        programs, compromise your phone&#x27;s security features, and may result
        in the Application not functioning correctly or at all.<br /><br /><br /><br />Please
        be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for
        certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active
        internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile
        network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the
        Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to
        Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.<br /><br /><br /><br />If
        you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware
        that your mobile network provider&#x27;s agreement terms still apply.
        Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data
        usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party
        charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any
        such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application
        outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without
        disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
        which you are using the application, they assume that you have obtained
        permission from the bill payer.<br /><br /><br /><br />Similarly, the
        Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of
        the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that
        your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you
        are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held
        responsible.<br /><br /><br /><br />In terms of the Service
        Provider&#x27;s responsibility for your use of the application, it is
        important to note that while they strive to ensure that it is updated
        and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to provide
        information to them so that they can make it available to you. The
        Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
        that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this
        functionality of the application.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Service
        Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The
        application is currently available as per the requirements for the
        operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend
        the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to
        download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The
        Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the
        application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the
        particular operating system version installed on your device. However,
        you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to
        you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the
        application and may terminate its use at any time without providing
        termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any
        termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
        will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary)
        delete it from your device.<br /><br /><br />Changes to These Terms and
        Conditions<br /><br />The Service Provider may periodically update their
        Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page
        regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any
        changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.<br /><br /><br /><br />These
        terms and conditions are effective as of 2024-10-05<br /><br /><br />Contact
        Us<br /><br />If you have any questions or suggestions about the Terms
        and Conditions, please do not hesitate to contact the Service Provider
